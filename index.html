<!-- 7. The content for the `index.html` should be unique to **you**.

   * Write a paragraph or two about yourself. Make it fun, show your personality!
   * The main logo where it says "Your Name" should say your name. This may make the logo section smaller or wider depending on how long your name isâ€”that is fine and expected.
   * Add, commit, and push your code to GitHub often, especially when you complete a page.

8. After all of your HTML is written, you can begin styling your pages using the `style.css` file you created.

   * Be sure to [validate your html](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input).
   * Consult the specs below these instructions for advice on styling your CSS files.

9. Push your changes to Github. -->
